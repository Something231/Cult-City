# Cult City - 2d City Simulator
## GamePoint:
    - You work as the leader of a cult called the council. You have been tasked in constructing a perfectly funcional town/city, so that the council     has a sufficient amount of people in such city, that some citizens can be "redacted" and sacrificed to your worthy cause. Of course this doesn't     mean you can be bad at your city construction, as you want to encourage population and economic growth as much as possible so that your city booms.

## Positive income
    - Money is earnt through cashflow:
        - The main source of cashflow will be taxes.
        - Fees for public transport, and tolls will also add to cashflow
        - Exports
    - Some events can add directly to cashflow:
        - A new resident entering the city

## Negative income
    - Preventable deaths? 
    - Government run operations: i.e. Education, Hospitals
    - Vandalism
    - Building things
    - Imports

## Utilities
    - Power
    - Water
    - Internet cabling
    - Building self sufficiency is possible too.

## City Growth
    - The council may construct and control buildings they create
        - The council rents out these unzoned buildings
        - The council may sell unzoned buildings.
    - The council can zone an area for particular buildings to be built there
        - The council does not own the zoned buildings, therefore has no control over it
        - The council can buy unzoned buildings for a high enough price

    - The council has the power to demolish any building.
    - Immigrants may enter the city when there is avaliable housing, and the rate is based on:
        - Appeal
        - Cost
    - Reproduction will only happen in homes that can sustain a family
    - Homelessness can occur if housing is too expensive or if buildings are demolished.

## Supression
    - The populus may plot assasination of the council
        - This must be stopped
    - The populus must be convinced into supporting the council
        - Bribery is an option
        - Fear is an option
        - Propaganda is an option
    - If the populus is not restrained, they may revolt
    - Additionally, labour unions may form if working conditions are bad, which can lead to protests and strikes
        - The best way to oppose that is through intense supression 
        - Or you could improve working conditions...
    - Unfavourable members of the public can be sacrificed, or if they are too powerful, they can be assasinated.

## Buildings
    - Buildings must be built on foundations.
    - The basic structure of a building must be designed before it is built
    - You cannot build onto existing buildings.
    - You cannot destroy parts of existing buildings, unless you fully demolish it
    - Buildings can be upgraded for different effects
    - Buildings are to be subdivided to rent out or sell individual segments
    - Subdivisions do no have to be the same type of building as other segments within the building
    - Zoning / Subdivision types:
        - Housing
        - Retail
        - Office
        - Warehouse
        - Factory

        - Church
        - Cult owned
        - ...
